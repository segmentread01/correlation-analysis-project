This project aims to analyse the feasibility of an authentic mobile application, inspired by openfoodfacts data. Openfoodfacts collects food product informations and give each a grade from A to E as the "Nutri-score". Based on the labelized data, we take initiation to analyse the correlation between product categories and nutri-score, then reduce variables by ACP dimension reduction.
